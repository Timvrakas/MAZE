Development ToDo List:
======================

*Reconnecting does not work. You can re-connect, but it throws an OSError when you try to capture
*The IMU Thread might not be terminating on disconnect()
*It's hard to debug things, beacuse the the manager always throws `convert_to_error(kind, result)`
*Preview-to-GUI needs to be added
*Status Indicators need to be added
*RAW->JPG conversion for Previews needs to be added (its in the old web branch)


*What's up with the scripts/ folder?
